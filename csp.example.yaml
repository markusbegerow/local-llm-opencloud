# 2. Modify the connect-src directives to match your LLM endpoints
# 3. Configure OpenCloud to use this CSP file (see README.md)

directives:
  connect-src:
    # Allow connections to same origin (required)
    - '''self'''

    # Allow all origins (recommended for development and testing)
    # SECURITY WARNING: This allows connections to ANY endpoint
    # For production, consider restricting to specific domains (see below)
